<div class="section"><div class="p" id="it_60_51_400005__net_define"><a name="it_60_51_400005__net_define"></a><a name="net_define"></a><span>FusionManager</span> supports three types of networks in a virtual private cloud
(VPC): direct network, internal network, and routed network.<ul><li>Direct network: <span>A direct network itself contains
no network resources, but it has direct access to external networks.
Therefore, VMs created on a direct network actually uses the IP addresses
provided by the connected external network, which can be the existing
network of the customer or the Internet.</span><div class="note"><img src="../theme/default/images/icon-note.gif"><span class="notetitle"> NOTE: </span><div class="notebody"><p>When creating
VMs in a direct network, you are advised to configure security groups
to isolate the VMs and implement VM access security control. </p>
</div></div>
</li><li>Internal network: An internal network is isolated from other networks
and uses exclusive network resources. Therefore, you can deploy services
that have high security requirements, for example, database server
services, on an internal network to ensure high data security.</li><li>Routed network: A routed network provides flexible communication
functions and supports various services. Routed networks in a VPC
can communicate with each other or the Internet. <span>A routed network also provides elastic IP address, access control
list (ACL), destination network address translation (DNAT), and virtual
private network (VPN) services. Before creating a routed network in
a VPC, ensure that you have applied for a virtual router for the VPC.</span></li></ul>
</div>
<div class="p"><span>FusionManager</span> also supports the following IP address allocation modes for
VMs in different types of networks to obtain IP addresses:<ul><li>Internal: <span>FusionManager</span> uses its internal Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
server to allocate IP addresses for VMs.</li><li>Static injection: <span>FusionManager</span> directly assigns an IP address to a VM when the VM is being
created.</li><li>Manual: After a VM is created, the administrator manually configures
an IP address for the VM.</li></ul>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Creating a Network</h4><p>Create a network in a
VPC based on the service requirements.</p>
</div>


<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Modifying a Subnet</h4><p>Modify the
settings of a subnet as needed.</p>
</div>


<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Deleting a Network</h4><p>If a network is not needed
any more, you can delete it from the system. Only networks that do
not have any VMs associated with can be deleted.</p>
</div>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Applying for a Private IP Address</h4><p>To manually configure an IP address for a service VM, you need
to obtain a private IP address from the routed network. The obtained
private IP address is mainly used to configure a floating IP address
for the VM.</p>
</div>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Associating a Router with an Internal Network</h4><p>Associate a router to an internal network to make the internal
network work as a routed network.</p>
</div>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Disassociating the Router from a Routed Network</h4><p>Disassociate the router from a routed network to make the routed
network change to an internal network. Consequently, all the advanced
network functions available to the original routed network will not
take effect for the internal network any more.</p>
</div>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Enabling SNAT</h4><p>SNAT is used
to translate the private IP address of a router into a public IP address,
allowing internal users to access external network services using
a shared public IP address.</p>
<p>If SNAT is enabled for a VPC, VMs
in a routed network in the VPC can connect to public networks.</p>
</div>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Disabling SNAT</h4><p>After SNAT is
disabled for a routed network, VMs in the routed network cannot access
the public network.</p>
