<h1 class="topictitle1">Networks</h1>


<div>
<div class="section"><p>The <span class="uicontrol"><b>Networks</b></span> page displays all
network resources created in the current cloud resource pool.</p>
<div class="p"><span>FusionManager</span> supports three types of networks in a virtual private cloud
(VPC): direct network, internal network, and routed network.<ul><li>Direct network: <span>A direct network itself contains
no network resources, but it has direct access to external networks.
Therefore, VMs created on a direct network actually uses the IP addresses
provided by the connected external network, which can be the existing
network of the customer or the Internet.</span><div class="note"><img src="../theme/default/images/icon-note.gif"><span class="notetitle"> NOTE: </span><div class="notebody"><p>When creating
VMs in a direct network, you are advised to configure security groups
to isolate the VMs and implement VM access security control. </p>
</div></div>
</li><li>Internal network: An internal network is isolated from other networks
and uses exclusive network resources. Therefore, you can deploy services
that have high security requirements, for example, database server
services, on an internal network to ensure high data security.</li><li>Routed network: A routed network provides flexible communication
functions and supports various services. Routed networks in a VPC
can communicate with each other or the Internet. <span>A routed network also provides elastic IP address, access control
list (ACL), destination network address translation (DNAT), and virtual
private network (VPN) services. Before creating a routed network in
a VPC, ensure that you have applied for a virtual router for the VPC.</span></li></ul>
</div>
<p>An
administrator is allowed to operate only the networks in a shared
VPC. For networks in a non-shared VPC, an administrator is only allowed
to view the network information.</p>
</div>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Creating a Network</h4><p>Create a network in a
shared VPC based on the service requirements. </p>
</div>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Deleting a Network</h4><p>If a network is not needed
any more, you can delete it from the system. However, a network in
use by a VM cannot be deleted.</p>
</div>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Enabling SNAT</h4><p>If an internal address initiates
a request to set up a service connection with a public network, the
gateway configured on the system router or firewall receives the connection
request and translates the internal address to an public IP address,
so that the internal address can access the public network using a
shared public IP address.</p>
<p>If SNAT is enabled for a VPC, VMs
in a routed network in the VPC can connect to the public network.</p>
</div>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Disabling SNAT</h4><p>If SNAT is disabled for a
VPC, VMs in a routed network in the VPC cannot access the public network
by network address translation.</p>
