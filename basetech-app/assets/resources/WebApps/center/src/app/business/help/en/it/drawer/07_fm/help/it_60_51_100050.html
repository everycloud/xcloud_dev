<h1 class="topictitle1">Resource Scheduling</h1>



<div><p></p>

<p>Configure policies for scheduling CPU and memory resources in a
cluster to implement dynamic resource scheduling and load balancing.
You can set the cluster resource scheduling mode to either manual
or automatic.</p>

<div class="section"><div class="dropdownexpand"><div class="dropdowntitle" onclick="ExpandorCollapseNode(this)"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Configuring Resource Scheduling</h4></div><div class="dropdowncontext"><p>If the automatic resource scheduling mode is configured, the resource
optimization policy automatically takes effect when the conditions
are met. If the manual resource scheduling mode is configured, manually
handle resource scheduling suggestions. The resource optimization
policy takes effect only after the resource scheduling suggestions
are manually handled.</p>
<p><strong>Dynamic Resource Scheduling</strong></p>
<div class="p">The dynamic resource scheduling function enables the system to use
an intelligent load balancing scheduling algorithm to periodically
check the load on each physical host in a cluster and migrate VMs
among hosts as needed. In this manner, the system can balance load
among hosts in the cluster. This function has the following characteristics:<ul><li>The migration automation level of a cluster can be set to automatic
or manual. In automatic mode, the system automatically migrates VMs
to the most appropriate host. In manual mode, the system provides
an operation suggestion for the system administrator to determine
whether to perform the operation as suggested.</li><li>Resources can be scheduled by CPU, memory, or CPU plus memory.
The VM performance is affected only when the memory overcommitment
function is enabled. Therefore, if memory overcommitment is not enabled,
scheduling by CPU is recommended to balance CPU usage in the cluster.
If memory overcommitment is enabled, scheduling by CPU plus memory
is recommended. </li><li>Advanced scheduling rules can be used to meet special resource
requirements. For example, a VM-mutually-exclusive rule can be configured
for two VMs that work in active/standby mode to ensure that the VMs
run on different hosts. This improves system reliability. </li><li>The time-based scheduling settings allow the system to schedule
resource in different time periods based on service requirements.
VM migration requires certain system overhead. Therefore, set a conservative
policy for a heavy-traffic scenario and a medium or radical policy
for a light-traffic scenario to ensure the optimal service performance. </li></ul>
</div>
<p><strong>Resource group</strong></p>
<p>A resource group is a collection of
VM groups and host groups. A resource group is used to configure the
same host group attributes for a group of VMs so that the VMs can
be migrated based on the specified rule. For example, if all VMs in
VM group 1 must run in host group 1, the destination hosts for migrating
these VMs must be those in host group 1. The mapping between VM groups
and host groups is configured in a rule.</p>
<p><strong>VM Scheduling Customization</strong></p>
<p>The VM scheduling customization function allows users to set a scheduling
automation level for each VM in a dynamic resource scheduling (DRS)
cluster to meet diverse VM scheduling automation level requirements.</p>
<p>The automation level customized for a VM prevails
over the automation level set for the cluster of the VM. You can set
different automation levels for a VM and its cluster. If the automation
level of a VM is set to <span class="parmname"><b>Disabled</b></span>, the system
will not migrate this VM or provide any migration suggestions for
it. If the VM scheduling customization function is disabled or the
automation level of a VM is set to <span class="parmname"><b>Default</b></span>, the
VM uses the same automation level as the cluster. </p>
