<h1 class="topictitle1">System Configuration</h1>



<div><p></p>

<p>System configuration refers to the configuration of the system
time and license. If this task has been completed during initial configuration, skip it.</p>

<div class="section"><div class="dropdownexpand"><div class="dropdowntitle" onclick="ExpandorCollapseNode(this)"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Time Management</h4></div><div class="dropdowncontext"><p>After installing the system, configure the time synchronization
policy and time zone on <span>FusionManager</span>, enabling <span>FusionManager</span> to use the local time and synchronize time with an external time
server.</p>
<p>If <span>FusionStorage</span> is used, the system automatically configures the time synchronization
policy and time zone for the FusionStorage Manager nodes of <span>FusionStorage</span> when you configure the <span>FusionManager</span> time synchronization policy and time zone.</p>
<p>You
are advised to preferentially configure an external Network Time Protocol
(NTP) clock source. If no external NTP clock source is available,
set the clock source to the host where the <span>FusionManager</span> VM is running.</p>
<p>If the time difference between <span>FusionManager</span> and the NTP server exceeds one minute, automatic time synchronization
fails, and the system generates an alarm. In this case, the administrator
needs to forcibly synchronize time with the NTP server based on the
alarm help guide. Forcible time synchronization may interrupt services.
Therefore, exercise caution when enabling forcible time synchronization.</p>
<div class="p">The verification rules for daylight saving time (DST) are as follows
(m indicates the selected month, and HH:MM indicates the selected
hour and minute):<ul><li>By date:<p>Start time: If the selected date is the last day in
m and HH:MM plus the offset is greater than or equal to 24 hours,
set the start date to the first day in the next month of m. If either
of the conditions is not met, retain m.</p>
<p>End time: If the selected
date is the first day in m and the offset subtracted from HH:MM is
less than or equal to 1 minute, set the end date to the last day in
the last month of m. If either of the conditions is not met, retain
m.</p>
<p>For example, if the start time is set to 02:00 on August
8, the end time is set to 00:00 on September 1, and the offset is
set to 60 minutes, the settings are invalid, because 60 minutes subtracted
from HH:MM is less than 1 minute. The real end time is 23:00 on August
31. However, the start date and the end date cannot be set in the
same month. Therefore, set the end time to 01:01 on September 1 or
later.</p>
</li><li>By week:<p>Start time: If the selected week is the last week in
m and HH:MM plus the offset is greater than or equal to 24 hours,
set the start week to the first week in the next month of m. If either
of the conditions is not met, retain m.</p>
<p>End time: If the selected
week is the first week in m and the offset subtracted from HH:MM is
less than or equal to 1 minute, set the end week to the last week
in the last month of m. If either of the conditions is not met, retain
m.</p>
<p>For example, if the start time is set to 23:00 in the last
Sunday in March, the end time is set to 01:00 in the first Sunday
in April, and the offset is set to 60 minutes, the settings are invalid,
because 60 minutes plus HH:MM is equal to 24 hours. The real end time
may be in April. However, the start date and the end date cannot be
set in the same month. Therefore, set the start time to 22:59 on last
Sunday in March or earlier.</p>
</li><li>By date and week:<p>Start time: If the time span between the specified
date and the last day in m is less than 8 days, set m to the next
month of m. If not, retain m.</p>
<p>End time: If the selected date
is the first day in m and the offset subtracted from HH:MM is less
than or equal to 1 minute, set the end week to the last week in the
last month of m. If either of the conditions is not met, retain m.</p>
<p>For example, if the start time is set to 08:00 on May 26, Sunday,
and the end time is set to 00:00 on June 8, Wednesday, the settings
are invalid, because the time span between May 26 and the last day
in May is less than 8 days. The real start time may be in June. However,
the start date and the end date cannot be set in the same month. Therefore,
set the start date to May 22 or earlier.</p>
