<h1 class="topictitle1">Advanced Attributes</h1>



<div><p></p>

<div class="p">You can configure advanced attributes of a resource cluster as
required, including high availability (HA) resource reservation, host
memory overcommitment, VM startup policy, Guest NUMA, and incompatible
migration cluster (IMC) policy.<div class="note"><img src="../theme/default/images/icon-note.gif"><span class="notetitle"> NOTE: </span><div class="notebody">You can only query the resource
clusters in the VMwarehypervisors
but cannot modify the advanced settings of these resource clusters.</div></div>
</div>


<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">HA resource reservation</h4><p>After HA resource
reservation is enabled, VMs on a host are migrated to other hosts
in the cluster by using the reserved resources when the host is faulty.</p>
</div>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Host memory overcommitment</h4><p>After memory
overcommitment is enabled for a host, VMs running on the host share
the memory resources, increasing VM density on the host.</p>
</div>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">VM startup policy</h4><p>After the VM startup policy
is configured, the system selects a host based on the configured policy
during VM startup.</p>
<ul><li><span class="parmvalue"><b>Assign automatically</b></span>: The system starts
a VM on a host that has available resources in the cluster.</li><li><span class="parmvalue"><b>Assign based on load balancing</b></span>: The system
starts a VM on a host that has lower CPU and memory usage.</li></ul>
</div>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Guest NUMA</h4><div class="p"><span>Guest NUMA presents a topology
view of memory and CPU resources on each host to VMs, the VM user
can configure VM CPUs and memory using the third-party software (such
as Eclipse) based on this topology, so that VMs can obtain the most
easy-to-access memory based on the topology, thereby reducing access
latency and improving VM performance. </span><div class="note"><img src="../theme/default/images/icon-note.gif"><span class="notetitle"> NOTE: </span><div class="notebody">Ensure
that the following conditions are met for the Guest NUMA function
to take effect:<ul><li>The number of VM CPUs supported by a host in the cluster must
be a multiple of the physical CPU quantity on the host or a multiple
of the thread quantity of a single CPU of the host. <p>The Guest NUMA function
may fail on the host that accommodates the VM if the host CPU quantity
changes (due to VM live migration or VM startup on another host) or
VM CPU specifications change.</p>
</li><li>The memory overcommitment function is disabled for the cluster.</li><li>The NUMA function is enabled for hosts in the cluster. To enable
the NUMA function for a host, choose <span class="menucascade"><b><span class="uicontrol">advanced</span></b> &gt; <b><span class="uicontrol">CPU configuration</span></b></span> in the advanced
basic input/output system (BIOS) settings of the host, and set <span class="parmname"><b>NUMA Support</b></span> to <span class="parmvalue"><b>Enabled</b></span>. </li><li>VMs on the hosts in the cluster are restarted after the Guest
NUMA function is enabled for the cluster.</li></ul>
</div></div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">IMC policy</h4><p>After the IMC policy is enabled
for a cluster, VMs can be migrated across hosts that use CPUs of different
performance baselines in the cluster. The IMC function allows the
hosts in a cluster to present the same CPU function set to VMs running
on them. This function ensures successful VM migration across these
hosts even when the hosts physically use CPUs of different performance
baselines.</p>
<div class="p">Ensure
that the following conditions are met for the IMC function if the
cluster contains hosts and VMs:<ul><li>The CPU generations of the hosts in the cluster are the same as
or later than the target IMC mode.</li><li>The CPU generations of the running or hibernated VMs in the cluster
are the same as or earlier than the target IMC mode. If any VM in
the cluster does not meet this requirement, the VM must be stopped
or migrated to another cluster.</li></ul>
</div>
<div class="p"><div class="note"><img src="../theme/default/images/icon-note.gif"><span class="notetitle"> NOTE: </span><div class="notebody">After setting an IMC mode for
a cluster, you need to enable the <span class="uicontrol"><b>Execute Disable Bit</b></span> function, which is also known as the No eXecute bit (NX) or eXecute
Disable (ND) function, in the BIOS advanced CPU options for existing
hosts in the cluster and the hosts to be added to the cluster.</div></div>
