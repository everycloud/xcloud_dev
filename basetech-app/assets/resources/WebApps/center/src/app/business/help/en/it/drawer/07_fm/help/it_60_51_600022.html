<h1 class="topictitle1">VM Snapshot Usage Requirements</h1>

<div>
<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Scenarios</h4>


<div class="p"><p>A snapshot is a reproduction of the data and state
of a VM created at a specific time point, and can be used to restore
a VM to the state when the snapshot was taken.</p>
<p>When you take a snapshot for a VM, the current
disk on the VM is set to be read-only. The system automatically creates
an incremental disk in the data store where the disk is located, and
the subsequent edit operations on the data of the disk are saved on
the incremental disk, that is, the incremental disk records the differences
between the current state of the disk and the last snapshot of the
disk. When you create another snapshot of the disk, the disk and its
current incremental disk are both set to read-only, and the system
creates another incremental disk in the data store. </p>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Usage Requirements</h4>


<div class="p"><div class="p"><ul><li>Memory snapshots cannot be created for VMs with USB devices attached. </li><li>Snapshots cannot be created for VM associated with graphics processing
units (GPUs). </li><li>Snapshots cannot be created for linked clones.</li><li>Snapshots cannot be created for quickly copied VMs.</li><li>If a VM is bound with a CPU, the snapshot created for the VM does
not contain information about the bound CPU information. Therefore,
if the snapshot is used to restore a VM, the restored VM does not
contain information about the bound CPU.</li><li>Multiple snapshots can be created for one VM. If a VM is being
restored using a snapshot, other snapshots of the VM are not affected.</li><li>A maximum of 32 snapshots can be created for one VM. Created snapshots
can only be manually deleted.</li><li>Snapshots cannot be created for VMs on which management nodes
are deployed.</li><li><p>Snapshots can be created only for VMs that
use storage whose type is Advanced SAN, FusionStorage, Local Pome,
LUN Pome, or NAS.</p>
<p>Snapshots cannot be created for VMs that use
storage whose type is local disk, SAN, or local RAM disk.</p>
</li><li>Snapshots cannot be created for VMs that use
storage of multiple types.</li><li>Memory snapshots cannot be created for VMs
whose disks use shared storage resources. Content in shared disks
is not included in the common snapshots and consistency snapshots. </li><li>If <span class="parmvalue"><b>Not taken into snapshots</b></span> is set for
a disk, the disk will not be backed up when a snapshot is taken for
the VM where the disk is located.</li><li>Memory snapshots can be create for a VM in the hibernating state,
and common snapshots can be create for a VM in the stopped state.</li><li>If a memory snapshot is taken for a running VM during VM snapshot
creation, the memory snapshot stores the VM disk data at that time.
If a memory snapshot is not taken for a running VM during VM snapshot
creation, the disk data in the VM snapshot may be inconsistent with
the disk data on the VM at that time.</li><li>After a snapshot is taken for a VM, the created delta disks will
occupy the storage resources in the data store. Therefore, you are
advised to limit the number of snapshots to be taken to prevent storage
resource shortage.</li><li>Do not perform any operation on a VM <span>when a snapshot
is being created for the VM</span>. After the snapshot is created, the
VM does not support storage live migration.</li><li>Do not perform any operation that is related to memory snapshot
of the VM when one of the following tasks are in progress:<ul><li>Live migrating the VM</li><li>Upgrading Tools</li><li>Adding VCPUs when the VM is in the running state</li><li>Restarting, hibernating, or stopping the VM</li></ul>
</li><li>A snapshot can be created for only one VM on a host at a time.</li><li>A consistency snapshot can
be created only when the following conditions are met:<ul><li>The VM disk type is Local Pome, LUN Pome, FusionStorage, or NAS.</li><li>The VM OS is Windows 7, Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008,
Windows Server 2008 R2, or Windows Vista.</li></ul>
