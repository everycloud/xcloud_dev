information, such as phone numbers and email addresses, ensure that
the information use complies with local laws and regulations.<ul><li>Phone number: used for alarm notification by SMS. This function
allows the system to send alarm information to the administrator or

administrator can view the phone numbers specified for all VDC administrators
and all tenants in the VDC. The administrator of a VDC can view the
phone numbers specified for all tenants in the VDC. After a phone
number is configured for a user, the number will be kept in the system
until being deleted from the system. In this version of <span>FusionManager</span>, the alarm notification by SMS function has not yet been delivered
for commercial use, though the phone number can be specified as part
of the personal information of a user added to the system. However,
the system will not use the collected phone number information for
other purposes. </li><li>Email address: used for alarm notification by email. This function
allows the system to send alarm information to the administrator or
tenants using emails after an alarm is generated. The system administrator
can view the email addresses specified for all VDC administrators

you will be logged out automatically. A shorter system timeout duration
provides higher security, but a longer timeout duration relieves the
need to log in multiple times. You can set the system timeout duration
based on your requirements.</p>
<p>After the system timeout duration
is configured, the configuration does not take effect for the current
user and takes effect the next time the user logs in to the system.</p>
